# SmartExpenseTracker-Java
A Smart Expense Tracker helps users manage and analyze their daily spending. Built with Java Swing, it allows users to record expenses, categorize them (like Food, Travel, Shopping), and visualize spending patterns over time. The data is saved locally using file handling or a simple database (like SQLite).
